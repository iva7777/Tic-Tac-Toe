## 1. Introduction 🎉

### Purpose of the Document 📄

This documentation serves as a guide for understanding a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides detailed information on the structure of the game, its mechanics, and how the different components interact with each other.

### Game Overview 🕹️

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

---

## 2. Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📝

To implement this Tic-Tac-Toe game, you should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 3. Game Mechanics ⚙️

### Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe 📋

- Players take turns to place their marks (❌ or ⭕) on the empty cells of the grid.
- The game ends when a player successfully gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner (a draw).

### Game Interface 🖼️

The game interface consists of a 3x3 grid where players place their marks and a "Restart" button to reset the game.

---

## 4. HTML Structure 🧱

### Game Board 🎮

The game board is represented using a 3 x 3 grid. Each part represents a position on the grid where a player can place their mark.

### Restart Button 🔄

A "Restart" button allows players to reset the game and start over. It can be implemented as a simple button element with an `id` for easy access in JavaScript.

Example:

```html
<button id="restart">Restart</button>
```

---

## 5. CSS Styling 🎨

### Board Styling 📐

The game board is styled using CSS to create a visually appealing grid. Consider using borders, margins, and paddings to create separation between cells.

### Cell Styling 📏

Style the individual cells to make them visually distinct when they are empty or contain a mark.

### Button Styling 🎛️

Apply CSS styles to the "Restart" button to make it stand out and provide visual feedback when interacted with.

---

## 6. JavaScript Logic 🧮

### Initializing the Game 🎲

- Use JavaScript to select the game board and cells by their `id` or `class`.
- Add event listeners to the cells to handle player moves.
- Initialize variables to keep track of the current player and the game state.

### Handling Player Turns 🔄

- Toggle between players' marks (❌ and ⭕) for each move.
- Update the cell's content with the current player's mark when they make a move.

### Checking for Win Conditions 🏆

- After each move, check if the current player has achieved a winning combination of marks.
- Winning combinations include three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

### Handling Game Over 🎉

- If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, disable further moves.
- Display a message indicating the winner or declaring a draw.
- Implement the "Restart" button's functionality to reset the game.
